# üß† AI Emergency Response System

An AI-based emergency alert system that integrates biosensor data, anomaly detection, computer vision, and real-time notifications. This project is designed to simulate how intelligent systems can support critical health and safety responses.

---

## üö® Project Summary

This system processes biosensor data such as heart rate and oxygen levels, detects anomalies using machine learning, and triggers alerts based on risk thresholds. Additionally, it integrates computer vision to simulate real-time environmental monitoring (e.g., detecting human presence via camera).

It was developed as part of an academic AI Lab project focusing on emergency applications of AI technologies.

## üîß Core Features

- **Physiological Anomaly Detection**  
  Using statistical modeling and machine learning to detect abnormalities in heart rate and oxygen saturation.

- **Computer Vision Integration**  
  Detects human presence and potential hazards using OpenCV-based camera input analysis.

- **Real-Time Alert Simulation**  
  Generates visual and textual alerts based on predefined thresholds and model outputs.

- **Data Analysis & Visualization**  
  Utilizes matplotlib and seaborn to analyze patterns and visually represent potential danger zones.
